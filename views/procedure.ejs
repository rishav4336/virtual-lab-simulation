            • This section includes all the basic fundamentals of PFRs and CSTRs such as their design equations, differences, combinations, etc. <br>
            • This is a prerequisite for better understanding of experimentation.

        <h4>Self Evaluation</h4> <hr>
        <p>
            • This section includes 5 questions for evaluating your concepts before proceeding to the experimentation. <br>
            • You are required to answer atleast 3 out of 5 questions correctly. <br>
            • If your score is less than 3 please revisit the theory section. <br>
            • Otherwise you can proceed to the <a href="simulation">Experimentation</a>.

            Step 1: Input the flow rate of NaOH (A) and Ethyl Acetate (B). <span style="background-color: rgb(201, 240, 253);">(preferably in the range of 3 - 20 LPH)</span>  <br><br>
            <i style="margin-left: 52px; font-size: 15px;">Please note that flow rate of NaOH should not be less than flow rate of Ethyl Acetate</i> <br> <br>
            Step 2: Input the normality of NaOH (A) and Ethyl Acetate (B). <span style="background-color: rgb(201, 240, 253);">(preferably in the range of 0.01 - 1 N)</span>  <br><br>
            Step 3: Set the temperature in the range of 25 - 40 &deg;C at which you want to conduct the experiment and click <span style="background-color: rgb(201, 240, 253);">next</span>. <br><br>
            Step 4: Select any number of PFRs and CSTRs in any combination with inputs(volume) of your choice. <br>
            <span style="margin-left: 52px; font-size: 15px; ">• To add a PFR choose required length and diameter and click on <span style="background-color: rgb(201, 240, 253);">Add PFR</span> button</span> <br>

            Step 5: Click Submit button to obtain final conversion and overall residence time. <br>
            <span style="margin-left: 54px;"></span>A graph betweeen final conversion and overall residence time at 3 different temperatures (T and T ± 5 &deg;C) <br><br>
            Step 6: Click <span>Calculations</span> to see the detailed calculation of the experimentation. <br><br>
            Step 7: Click <span>Show Data</span> to check the data of the graph.
